Store and Reuse functions that will be repeated throughout a project.
- Define a function, e.g:

def something():
    print('Hello')
    print('Fun')

- Call the program function:
thing()


There are two kinds of functions in python:
- Built-in functions that are provided as part of python, like print() input() type() float() int()
- Functions that we define and then use
- We treat the built-in function name as "new" reserved words (i.e., we avoid them as variable names)


Function Definition:
- In python a fucntion is some reusable code that takes arguments as input, does some computation, and then returns a result or results
- We define a function using the def reserved word
- We call/invoke the function by using the funciton name, parantheses, and arguments in an expression

Example:

>>>big = max('Hello world')
>>>print(big)
w

big ---> is the assignment statement
max ---> is a built in function that is being called with an argument, in this case it will return the letter with the highest numeric value
'Hello world' ---> is the argument used in the max function
w ---> is the result of the max function of the argument
