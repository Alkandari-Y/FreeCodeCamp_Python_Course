Iterations: Definite Loops:

Definite Loops:
- Quite often have a list of items of the lines in a file - effectively a finite set of things
- We can write a loop to run the loop once for each of the items in a set using the python for contruct
- These loops are called "definite loops" because they execute an exact number of times
- We can say that "definite loops iterate through the members of a set"

Run the script same.py which contains:
>>>for i in [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]:
        print(i)
>>>print('Blastoff!')

Results of the script:
5
4
3
2
1
Blastoff!

A definite loop with strings:
example from sample_2.py:
>>>friends = ['Joseph', 'Glenn', 'Sally']
>>>for friend in friends:
        print('Happy New Year: ', friend)
>>>print('Done!')

result:
Happy New Year:  Joseph
Happy New Year:  Glenn
Happy New Year:  Sally
Done!

We can see that definite loops (for loops) have explicit iteration variables that change each time through a loop. These iteration variables move through the sequence or set

Note: Even though these examples ae simple, the patterns apply to all kinds of loops
