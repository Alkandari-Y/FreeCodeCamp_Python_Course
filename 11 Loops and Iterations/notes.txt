Loops and Iterations:

Repeated Steps:
- Loops (repeated steps) have iteration variables that change each time through a loop. Often these iteration variables go through a sequence of numbers.

Sample code:
>>>n = 5
>>>while n > 0
        print(n)
        n = n - 1
>>>print('Blastoff!')
>>>print(n)

Output will be
5
4
3
2
1
Blastoff
0

In the case above the variable n is the iteration variable and the while statement executes until the condtiion n > is no longer true 
While loops function like an if statement - it's a question that leads to a true or a false answer but unlike an if statement, after it has run the code once, it repeats the question again until it longer can
The iteration variable limits the number of times a while loop can repeat itself


Infinite Loops;
The code below highlights a poorly constructed loop:

>>>n = 5
>>>while n > 0:
    print('Lather')
    print('Rinse')
>>>print('Dry off!')


Breaking out of a loop:
- The break statement ends the current loop and jumps to the statement immediately following the loop- It is like a loop test that can happen anywhere in the body of the loop

example:
>>>while True:
    line = input('> ')
    if line == 'done':
        break
    print(line)
>>>print('Done!')

The exmaple above runs the code Infinitely allowing the user to input a string and print it until the user types into the input prompt a string with 'done' to break out of the loop

Finishign an iteration with continue:
- The continue statement ends the current iteration and jumps to the top of the loop and starts the next iteration

exmaple:
>>>while True:
    line = input('> ')
    if line[0] == '#':
        continue
    if line == 'done':
        break
    print(line)
>>>print('Done!')

Output:
>hello there
hello there
># don't print this
print this!
>done
Done!

Indefinite Loops:
- while loops are called "indefinite loops" because they keep going until a logical condtiion becomes false

Definte Loops:
- interating over a set of items
