Constants:
They are fixed values (inlcudes, numbers, letters, and strings with either single or double quotes) that do not change.

Examples
print(123)
print(98.6)
print('Hello World)


Reserved Words:

RESERVED_WORDS = [
    'False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'break', 'class', 'if', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'return', 'for', 'from',
    'global', 'try', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lamda', 'while', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'finally', 'continue', 'nonlocal', 'with', 'yield'
]

\"The other foundational notion of any programming language are the reserved words... where python is listening for them and they have special meaning\"


Variables:

-A variable is a named place in the memory where a programmer can store data and later retrieve the data using the variable name.
>Its best practice 

-You can change the contents of a variable in a later statement

x = 12.2
y = 14
x =100

-Variable names are chosen by the programmer. There are however rules, and they include:
> Must start witha letter or underscore
> Must consist of letters, numbers, and underscores
> Case sensitve

good_examples_of_names = [
    'spam', 'eggs', 'spam23', '_speed'
]

bad_examples_of_names = [
    '23spam', '#sign', 'var.12'
]

different = [
    'spam', 'Spam', 'SPAM'
]


-Assignment Statement:
>We assign a value to a variable using the assignemnt statmen(=)
>An assignment statment consists of an expression on the right-hand-side and a variable to store the result

x = 3.9 * x * (1 - x)
