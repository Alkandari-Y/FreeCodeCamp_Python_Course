Elements of python:

Vocabulary / words : variables and reversed words (chapter 2)
Sentence structure : valid syntax patterns (chapters 3-5)
Story structure : contrusting a program for a purpose

sample script (similar to lesson 1 - unmodified from video):

name = raw_input('Enter file: ')
handle = open(name)

counts = dict()
for line in handle:
    words = line.split()
    for word in words:
        counts[word] = count.get(word, 0) + 1

bigcount = None
bigword = None

for word, count in counts.items():
    if bigcount is None or count > bigcount:
        bigcount = count
        bigword = word

print(bigword, bigcount)


Python has a series of reserved words which cannot be used as variable names or identifiers. 
\"[P]ython expects that when you use these words that they're going to mean exactly what python expects to mean.\"

RESERVED_WORDS = [
    'False', 'None', 'True', 'and', 'as', 'assert', 'break', 'class', 'if', 'def', 'del', 'elif', 'else', 'except', 'return', 'for', 'from',
    'global', 'try', 'import', 'in', 'is', 'lamda', 'while', 'not', 'or', 'pass', 'raise', 'finally', 'continue', 'nonlocal', 'with', 'yield'
]

Python Sentences:

x = 2       <----- Assignment Statement
x = x + 2   <----- Assignment with Expression
print(x)    <----- Print Statement

variable in that case above         = x
operator in the case above          = + 'and the' =
constant in that case above         = 2
reserved word in that case above    = print()

Python Paragraphs:
Interactive python is good for experimenting with scripts and programs between 3-4 lines of code
Larger files should be savd in a file and run from the command line/python
files are pretty much scripts
python file suffix is .py (at the end of the file name)

Interactive vs Script:
Interactive
pythons responds to code written one line at a time

Script
A sequence of statments can be written in file and python will execute the statments in the file


Program Steps:

A series of introductions or steps to be done in order
Conditionals may be skipped
Can repeat a step of groups of steps
repeated steps can be stored throughout the program to be used as needed
